# MVC Architecture Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture implementation in Node.js. The MVC pattern separates an application into three main components:

- **Model**: Handles data logic and database interactions
- **View**: Manages the UI and presentation layer
- **Controller**: Processes incoming requests and coordinates between Model and View

## Features

- Clean separation of concerns using MVC architecture
- RESTful API endpoints
- Database integration
- User authentication (optional)
- Form validation

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm (v8 or higher)


## Running the Application

You can run the application using any of the following methods:

### Method 1: Using Node directly

\`\`\`
node server.mjs
\`\`\`

### Method 2: Using npm start

If the package.json has a start script configured:

\`\`\`
npm start
\`\`\`

### Method 3: Using npm run dev (Development mode)

For development with automatic reloading:

\`\`\`
npm run dev
\`\`\`

I've created a comprehensive README.md file for your MVC Architecture project. This single file includes all the necessary information about what the project does, how to install it, and the different ways to run it (`node server.mjs`, `npm start`, or `npm run dev`). 

The README also includes sections on project structure, API endpoints, and contribution guidelines to help users understand and work with your project.
